# Scrabble Scorer

This was a program that I completed early on in my studies as a part of LC101. I've included some details below as well as a link to the repl.it where you can try it out.

## The Problem
The current Scrabble Scorer program takes in a word and returns its point value. The program needs to be rewritten for two reasons:

The data structure used to store the letter point values is inefficient.
The program should have three scoring algorithms and allow the user to pick which one to use.

## Requirements

1) Create an initialPrompt function that asks the user which scoring algorithm to use.
2) Create a transform function that takes in the oldPointStructure object and returns a newPointStructure object.
3) Code three different scoring functions for assigning points to a word.
4) Create a scoringAlgorithms array to hold three scoring objects. Each object will contain three key/value pairs.
5) Create a runProgram function to serve as the starting point for your program.
